# Knowledge Exchange Seminar

Indicated below is the person responsible for presenting a paper/topic and sending out a reminder for the same. Meetings dates, venue and timings will be decided -- preferably over Shawarma or [Cafreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafreal) Pao. The nature of the paper/topic would be such that it is not only accesible to every researcher, but stimulating enough to spark off collaborations.
