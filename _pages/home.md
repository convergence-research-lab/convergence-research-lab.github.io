We are a small, independent and interdisciplinary research group based out of Goa, India. Our aim is to to conduct fundamental and applied research in the sciences, engineering as well as the social sciences. We thrive off collaborative work fostered by the exchange of ideas and development of analogies across traditional discplines. 

Our current interests lie in all possible combinations of Machine Learning, Data Science, Clinical Psychology, Neuroscience, Game Theory, Network Science, Emergent Behavior and Coordination, Theoretical Physics, Cancer Biology, Mathematical Sociology and Education. Our [weekly seminars]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/seminar) cover these topics and are open to all.

Given the degree of institutionalization of the modern world, research outside traditional academia or industry has been a largely unexplored terrain. The creation of our group is a bid to experiment with settings in which research can thrive. Our organizational structure and philosophy as been inspired by the [Pacfic Science Institute](http://www.pacificscienceinstitute.org/) and the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/). We dedicate our research activites to the Indian polymath [D. D. Kosambi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damodar_Dharmananda_Kosambi) who excelled in mathematics, statistics, history, genetics as well as numismatics.

We offer analytics and [consultancy services]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/consult) to corporates as a way of funding our activities. 

We are currently located at <i> [Mais Space](https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Vidyavriksh/@15.4863599,73.818404,15z) </i>, a studio which enables learning. Situated in Panaji, Goa -- it is a space supported by the Fomento Group, which enables us to access rescourses at the Fomento Knowledge Office (FKO). 

 **We are looking for passionate seasoned / graduate / independent researchers as well as enterprising undergraduates to join the team as resident researchers or as remote collaborators** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/join) **!**
