- title: Fence synthesis using happens-before formulas

  description: For performance reasons, modern processors execute multiple instructions in parallel, executing each instruction as soon as its operands are available. To prohibit harmful weak memory behaviors, the programmer has to introduce barrier instructions that block the reordering of memory events. In this paper, we algorithmically determine an optimal placement of fences that ensure that, given a concurrent program and a safety property which holds under sequential consistency, the property holds for finite unrolling of loops. The paper is currently under review for <a href="http://www.fsttcs.org/"> FSTTCS 2017 </a>
