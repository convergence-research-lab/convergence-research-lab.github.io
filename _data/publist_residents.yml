- title: Towards a dS/MERA correspondence
  image: MERA.png
  description: Recent advances have suggested that spacetime itself emerges from the entanglement of the quantum degrees of freedom living on the boundary. In this paper, we suggest a prescription for the dS/MERA correspondence and recover a discrete version of the de Sitter spacetime. Time appears as an emergent direction, with implications of cosmological relevance.
