- title: Towards a dS/MERA correspondence
  image: 
  description: Recent advances have suggested that spacetime itself emerges from the entanglement of the quantum degrees of freedom living on the boundary. In this paper, we suggest a prescription for the dS/MERA correspondence and recover a discrete version of the de Sitter spacetime. Time appears as an emergent direction, with implications of cosmological relevance.

- title: Universality of pseudo gap and emergent order in lightly doped Mott insulators
  image: Pub_M2PG.png
  description:
    We discover of electronic order, pseudo gap phase separation and an impurity-band Mott transition in an iridate compound, cuprate-style. Along the way, we gained unique knowledge on how a Mott state collapses.
